<p>My name is Minh-Quan Nguyen. I am currently a Junior at the University of California Berkeley, pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I enjoy both aspects of electrical engineering as well as computer science with an interest in computer archetecture. In my spare time, I like to practice martial arts and relax by playing on the piano. I'm an avid video gamer and a nerd to anything tech. Some of my interests include building Legos, watching movies, and surfing the web. You can view my projects <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>, my resume <a href="resume.html">here</a>, and contact me <a href="contact.html">here</a>. </p>
